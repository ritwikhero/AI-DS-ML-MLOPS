    "### Assignment 2: Accessing List Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the first, middle, and last elements of the list created in Assignment 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: List Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the first five elements, the last five elements, and the elements from index 5 to 15 of the list created in Assignment 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new list containing the squares of the first 10 positive integers using a list comprehension. Print the new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Filtering Lists\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a nested list and flattens it into a single list. Print the original and flattened lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 11: List Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a list of the first 10 positive integers. Remove the elements at indices 2, 4, and 6, and insert the element '99' at index 5. Print the modified list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: List Zipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two lists of the same length. Use the `zip` function to combine these lists into a list of tuples and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: List Reversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. Print the original and reversed lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: List Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that rotates a list by n positions. Print the original and rotated lists.\n",
